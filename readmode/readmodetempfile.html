<p>HERO. ðŸ‘‡</p><p><i>[Heads up that this is intense and there's some language]</i></p><p>More <a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/vermont-state-police-troopers-pulls-off-incredible-rescue-after-girl-falls-through-ice-into-pond/46366742#">details</a> on this situation that happened last month (camera footage was just released on January 11):</p><blockquote><p>Vermont State Trooper Michelle Archer responded to a home on East View Road in Cambridge on Dec. 17 after a report that an 8-year-old girl and her 6-year-old sibling had fallen through ice into a pond on their property while playing.</p><p>Archer, who was on patrol in the area, was able to get to the pond less than five minutes after the call and quickly dove into the icy waters with a rope and flotation device to rescue the child, according to police. The other child had already been rescued by the nearby homeowner.</p><p>Archer was able to successfully bring the child out of the water and hand her off to Trooper Keith Cote, who took her to a waiting ambulance for treatment.</p></blockquote><p>Trooper Archer was uninjured in the rescue as well.</p><p>Wish I had some deets on where the parents were when this was happening, but I'm just glad these girls survived.</p><h2>ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª</h2>
